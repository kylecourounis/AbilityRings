# AbilityRings (1.17.1)
 
This is the source code for a Minecraft mod that adds a few rings that buff the player when equipped in the their inventory. 

This is the first public mod I've made in a very, very long time. The last time I worked with Minecraft Forge was back in the 1.12.2 days, and my last published mods were for 1.10.2. This was my first time utilizing DataGenerators, which refers to the new(ish) item modeling, localization, and recipe systems.
